Sprint #5.
File reviewed is named PlatformStates.cs.
File author is Huahui Wu.
The PlatformStates file has a basic platform state that probably could've 
been named as abstract, with three concrete platform states called 
PlatformStopState, PlatformHorizontalState, and PlatformVerticalState.
By the name of these states, it appears that some platforms will take on 
the horizontal state while other platforms will be in a vertical state.
The transitions between platform states does not seem to exist apart from 
nebulously named methods like PlatformStopState, PlatformVerticalState,
and PlatformHorizontalState, which share the same names as the classes,
and could cause confusion. A better way to transition between states is
to name the transitions methods what kind of state transition it will
perform. Such as the need for a horizontal platform to reverse its
direction, the state transition method name could be ReverseDirection,
with the appropriate entity property changes made, and the method could
be a part of the concrete class, instead of all transitions being part of
the supposedly abstract PlatformState class.
