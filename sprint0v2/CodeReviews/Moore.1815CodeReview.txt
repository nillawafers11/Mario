This is our class that implements parallax for our background scrolling.
It is Well organized And works great. A few changes that might possibly make the class better.
Currently it is possible to set two layers to the same depth. That might cause an error if done by mistake.
If Add Layer became public and we had an Update() method it might be possible to add layers to the
background maybe to build a dynamic weather system or something. It also doesn’t have any error handling
but again. I have not seen it error so maybe that would not be necessary.
