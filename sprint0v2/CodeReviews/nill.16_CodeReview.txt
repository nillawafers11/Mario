Comments:
- Update is cluttered. Can seperate a lot of the timer stuff into helper methods.
- Draw is standard.
- Why the need to set the delayElapsedTime and this.delay twice? Once in the constructor, the other in Initialize.

Minutes to complete: 5
Hypothetical change: The movement on the fireworks could be similarly adapted for Cheep Cheeps or Bloopers.
